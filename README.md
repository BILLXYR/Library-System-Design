This is an web-application. It has two main users: normal users and admin users. 

Normal users can search, reserve, borrow and return the books. 
It can also check whether it has any outstanding payment and make the payment accordingly.

Admin users can view the list of books being borrowing and reserved as well as the users with outstanding payment.
